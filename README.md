Background
My site will have information about the commodities market for people who want to get a basic understanding of what they are and how they work. It also provides interesting economic facts that people can enjoy and interact with.

Users will see images the commodities included and have the option to click on whichever one they are interested in, showing them information on each one.

This project will have clear instructions for how to utilize the website.



Layout
This is a basic representation of the main page.
NAVBAR - Links, home, the varios sections of the page.

Center - Include images to interact with and learn from.

Bottom - a final quiz to test the knowledge received.
