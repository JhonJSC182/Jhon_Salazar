Background
My site will have information about the commodities market for people who want to get a basic understanding of what they are and how they work. It also provides interesting economic facts that people can enjoy and interact with. The information will include why prices increase/decrease, the effects it has on the overall economy and why it is important for the well-being of regular people.
Functionality
Users will have a visual representation of each commodity and have the option to click on whichever one they are interested in so they can be taken to another page to receive more in-depth information about that commodity.
This project will have clear instructions for how to utilize the website and it will also include a read me.

Layout
This is a basic representation of the main page.
